Recycle Again
---

> Contains bootstrap code for a robot. Let's use it for the Recycle Rush robot.

This project only contains a simple Robot class and everything needed to *deploy* to the robot. The robot doesn't do anything yet; it's up to you guys to write the rest of the code!
 
### Getting Started

1. Fork the repository.
2. Use **Import from GitHub** in IntelliJ IDEA to clone your fork.
